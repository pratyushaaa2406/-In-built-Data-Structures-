#Program 8: Program to Put Even and Odd elements in a List into Two Different Lists

#Create a list
numbers=[10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50]

#Sort the even and odd elements
even_num=[num for num in numbers if num%2==0]
odd_num=[num for num in numbers if num%2!=0]

#print the results
print("Even numbers: ",even_num)
print("Odd numbers: ",odd_num)
